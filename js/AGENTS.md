# JavaScript Guidelines

- Use ES modules (`import`/`export`) and prefer `const` or `let`; avoid `var`.
- End statements with semicolons and keep indentation at 2 spaces.
- Favor arrow functions when possible.
- Place shared utilities inside `js/common/` and keep files in kebab-case.
- Keep line lengths under 120 characters.
