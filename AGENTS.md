# Working with this Repository

- Follow the settings in `.editorconfig` (2 spaces, UTF-8, trim trailing whitespace, and end files with a newline).
- Use concise commit messages in the imperative mood (e.g. "Add login form").
- After making changes, run `UI_URL=/ui npm run build` to ensure the project builds successfully.
- Do not commit built artifacts such as the `dist/` folder or any files ignored by `.gitignore`.
- Do not commit any changes to `package-lock.json`. If any dependencies change, just commit changes to `package.json`.
