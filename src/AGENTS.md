# Template Guidelines

This directory contains Handlebars templates used by Parcel.

- Use 2â€‘space indentation and avoid trailing whitespace.
- File names should be in kebab-case and use the `.hbs` extension.
- Pages live under `pages/` and partials under `partials/`.
- Use `{{> partial-name }}` to include partials.
- When adding scripts, load them with `<script type="module">`.
